        <p>Allow me to help you make sound decisions in planning and developing your website. 
            I have been making websites for a couple years now. The first website I made was with
            Wix! (lol). It got the job done, but the service was very expensive and unfulfilling.
            Shortly after, I jumped in way over my head and developed a word press site. 
            This was a frustrating experience because at the time I had no prior knowledge of the web
            yet alone, how to code. It got to the point where it became extremely time consuming, only  with
            untreated results. 
        </p>
        
        <p> Allow me to share with you the knowledge and insights I have gained from these experiences.
            Developing your website should be an exciting time for you. I can spare you some agony because I 
            have been there myself.
            
        </p>
        <p> I have been studying web development for about a year now. I just finished a 10
            week course that helped me further develop skills. I am now able to incorporate
            javascript within the projects I will be building. Further down the line, I would 
            like to employ back-end technology to build more complex web experiences for
            clients.</p>
