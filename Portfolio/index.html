        <p>Hello. My name is Donald and I am a front-end web developer. I will be utilizing 
        this website to showcase my work and also highlight my services for anyone who 
        needs help with developing their website.
        </p>
        <p> I have been studying web development for about a year now. I just finished a 10
        week course that helped me further develop skills. I am now able to incorporate
        javascript within the projects I will be building. Further down the line, I would 
        like to employ back-end technology to build more meaningful web experiences for
        clients.
